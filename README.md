# World_Weather_Analysis

The instructions for this challenge didn't say we should do much with this README.  I 
figure I could write something in here.

## Part 1: Weather Database
Compiled a list of vacation locations and their weather.  

## Part 2: Vacation Search
Filtered down the list of possible locations to desired temperatures of 70 to 85 degree Fahrenheit.

## Part 3: Vacation Itinerary
Selected locations that were relatively near each other in Mexico, a location that I could reasonably get to without a 
ton of travel.
